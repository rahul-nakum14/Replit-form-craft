Please go through this project and fix the following issues. The goal is to make the application fully functional and error-free on local development. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the current problems:

1. Environment Configuration
Fix the error: Error: DATABASE_URL must be set. Did you forget to provision a database?

Ensure .env file is loaded correctly.

Set up a working .env.example file with necessary variables like DATABASE_URL, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, MONGODB_URI, etc.

Add fallback or development default values where applicable.

2. Database Integration
The app is currently trying to use Drizzle but throws errors related to the DATABASE_URL. Clarify:

Are we using Drizzle ORM or MongoDB (or both)? If MongoDB, then remove unnecessary Drizzle configuration.

Fix issues in services/mongodb.ts:

Validate MongoDB connection logic.

Add proper error handling for failed connections.

Ensure it's not trying to reconnect on every API call.

3. Authorization / Authentication
When updating profile info, an error shows: Authorization is required.

Ensure protected routes and APIs check user session/token properly using NextAuth or the chosen auth method.

Add middleware or route guards if missing.

4. Checkout Page
Checkout flow is broken or incomplete.

Fix any API routes related to payment processing or order creation.

Ensure any premium logic (such as plan validation) is working.

Confirm whether a payment provider (Stripe?) is correctly set up.

5. Premium Features
You mentioned "API access" for premium users, but it is not functional.

Implement actual API access control based on user subscription.

Add UI components to view or generate API keys.

Create endpoint to verify API key and usage limits.

6. Support Section
Clicking on "Support" does nothing or behaves incorrectly.

Make the Support link functional:

Either open a modal, navigate to a support form page, or trigger an email intent.

Ensure the mail client opens with the correct mailto: link if that's the intended behavior.

7. Analytics Page
The Analytics section throws: Error loading analytics.

Fix the data fetching logic (likely an API route or DB issue).

Add loading/error states on the frontend.

Make sure the user has permission to view analytics.

8. Local Development Instructions
Provide a clear README or documentation for local setup.

Include:

.env setup

Database setup (MongoDB / Drizzle?)

How to run dev server (npm run dev or yarn dev)

Seeding or dummy data instructions

Optional: Docker setup

Final Deliverable:
A fully functional local development environment with all major features (auth, API, premium access, analytics, support) working without throwing errors.
